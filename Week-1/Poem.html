        <h1>Poem</h1>

        I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br>
        Are you -Nobody- Too? <br>
        Then there's a pair of us!<br>
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br><br>

        How Dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
        How public - like a Frog - <br>
        To tell one's name - the livelong June - <br>
        To an admiring bog -<br><br>

        <cite>By Emily Dickinson (1891)</cite>
